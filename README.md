# particleBox

Left click and drag to create particles (right-click for anti-particles).
Particles will explode on collisions with enough velocity, and anti-particles and particles will annihalate eachother!

Use WASD to move the camera around, and RF and TG to change the mass of created particles.
Use Q to slow down time, and E to speed up time.

Warning: may crash with too many particles.
